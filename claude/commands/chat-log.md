## Your Task

1. Generate a markdown file with details about our conversation
2. Give it a short, descriptive title (alphanumeric and underscores only, less than 50 characters) and filename
3. Include a brief summary of what we achieved
4. Create a section that lists each prompt I gave you with clear delineation between what I said and the actions you took afterward
5. The goal of this document is to share information with other developers about how we work together
